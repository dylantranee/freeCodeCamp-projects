      <h1>King Ranch Chicken Casserole</h1>
      <p>This classic King Ranch chicken casserole is bursting with chicken, corn tortillas, tomatoes, peppers, and cheesy goodness. From what I hear, it's impossible to go to any sort of potluck in Texas and not see one of these.</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
          <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Saute onion and bell peppers in the hot oil until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
          <li>Add both cans of condensed soup, diced tomatoes with chile peppers, chicken broth, sour cream, cumin, ancho chile powder, oregano, and chipotle chile powder; mix until sauce is well-combined.</li>
          <li>Spread a few tablespoons of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer with 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the sauce, 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese, and 1/2 of the tortillas.</li>
          <li>Spread the remaining chicken over the tortillas. Spread all but 1/2 cup of the remaining sauce over the chicken, then top with another 1/3 of the Cheddar, and the remaining tortillas. Spread the remaining 1/2 cup over top, and sprinkle with the remaining Cheddar.</li>
          <li>Bake casserole in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 40 minutes.</li>
          <li>Turn on the broiler and broil until the top is golden, 2 to 3 more minutes.</li>
          <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
